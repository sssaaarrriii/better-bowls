About Better Bowls
Better Bowls is the most delicious way to hit your protein goal. We make high protein yogurt bowls that are nutritious and delicious. Each Better Bowl features our premium blend of greek yogurt and whey protein which is topped with fresh fruit like strawberries, bananas, blueberries and superfood toppings such as chia seeds and hemp hearts. The medium size bowl features 40g of protein and the large bowl features 60g of high quality and easy to digest protein. Better Bowls is the perfect post workout meal, a filling breakfast, or a lunch time protein packed option. Better Bowls are made to order and the website described in this document will allow customers to make customizations to their bowl, place an order for pickup, and checkout online with their preferred payment option.

About me
Hey! My name is Sari and I wanted to share a little bit about the story behind Better Bowls.

I started going to the gym nearly 10 years ago and I started working out more seriously about 5 years ago. As I was pushing myself at the gym, I started feeling more tired and fatigued in my day to day life. On top of that, my progress started to plateau and I was feeling frustrated, but I wasn’t sure why. After many conversations with gym friends and a consultation with a nutritionist, I found out that I was severely undereating protein.

But it was very difficult to consume the recommended 150g of protein per day. That would involve eating 1-2 pounds of meat. Every single day.

After looking at high protein alternatives I found out that Greek Yogurt is very high in protein and has many other health benefits such as probiotics which improve gut health. I went on to experiment with dozens of protein powders to create the perfect recipe that involves a creamy and delicious organic greek yogurt base mixed with highly purified whey protein for smoother blending and no after taste. That’s how Better Bowls was born! We make it easier to get 40-60g of protein in one delicious bowl.

Product Principles
Mobile first
The website will be primarily access on mobile and should be responsive and fast
It should be possible to order a bowl for pickup in 10 seconds (without making customizations). It should be a very simple flow with 3-4 screens and it should not require login or creating an account, that’s just annoying for users
Visual and appetizing
The site should include beautiful visuals including product photos that are appetizing
Premium and sleek
The site should feel elevated to communicate the premium price point while still being modern, sleek, and visually appealing/appetizing
Informational
The product details page should clearly explain the product, communicate allergy restrictions, explain the benefit of better bowls, communicate the uniqueness of our greek yogurt and protein blend
